=== Experiment 1: Unigram vs Bigram vs Trigram vs 4-gram (REAL data) ===
[INFO] Loaded REAL dataset for experiments:
  Train size = 120000
  Test  size = 20

n-gram order	Accuracy (REAL data)
1		0.3500
2		0.3500
3		0.3500
4		0.3500

(Interpretation suggestion)
- Unigram ignores word order → usually weakest.
- Bigram adds minimal context.
- Trigram often best balance between context and sparsity.
- 4-gram on REAL short headlines likely suffers heavy sparsity.


=== Experiment 2: Effect of smoothing alpha (trigram, REAL data) ===
[INFO] Loaded REAL dataset for experiments:
  Train size = 120000
  Test  size = 20

alpha	Accuracy (REAL data)
0.10	0.4000
0.50	0.3500
1.00	0.3000

(Interpretation suggestion)
- Smaller alpha → rely more on observed n-gram counts.
- Larger alpha → stronger smoothing, probabilities more uniform.
- On REAL data, too much smoothing can blur class differences.


=== Experiment 3: Effect of training set size (REAL data) ===
[INFO] Loaded REAL dataset for experiments:
  Train size = 120000
  Test  size = 20

Train fraction	#Train samples	Accuracy (REAL data)
1.0		120000		0.3500
0.5		60000		0.3000
0.2		24000		0.1500

(Interpretation suggestion)
- As we reduce REAL training data, sparsity becomes more severe.
- Performance drop quantifies how data-hungry n-gram LMs are.
- Good figure: accuracy vs. train fraction on REAL dataset.


=== Experiment 4: Robustness to noisy REAL test input ===
[INFO] Loaded REAL dataset for experiments:
  Train size = 120000
  Test  size = 20

Accuracy on CLEAN REAL test set : 0.3500
Accuracy on NOISY REAL test set : 0.3500

Sample clean vs noisy examples (REAL data):
------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN: Three quarters of financial firms still conducting anti-money laundering checks manually
NOISY: Three quarters of financial firms still conducting anti-money laundering checks manually
True label : 2 - Business
Pred clean : 0 - World
Pred noisy : 0 - World
------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN: European stocks rally on hope ECB may be done with interest rate hikes
NOISY: European stocks rally on hope ECB may be done with interest rate hikes
True label : 2 - Business
Pred clean : 2 - Business
Pred noisy : 2 - Business
------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN: Gold prices have hit a new high, while the value of Bitcoin has also surged.
NOISY: Gold prices have a hit new high, while the value Bitcoin has also surged.
True label : 2 - Business
Pred clean : 2 - Business
Pred noisy : 2 - Business
------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN: Why food discount stickers may be a thing of the past
NOISY: Why food discount stickers may be a thing of the past
True label : 2 - Business
Pred clean : 3 - Sci/Tech
Pred noisy : 3 - Sci/Tech
------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN: German cabinet tries to solve ‘no-debt’ crisis after court outlaws budget
NOISY: German cabinet tries to solve ‘no-debt’ crisis after court outlaws budget
True label : 2 - Business
Pred clean : 2 - Business
Pred noisy : 2 - Business

(Interpretation suggestion)
- If accuracy drops a lot on noisy REAL headlines,
  it shows n-gram LM is sensitive to word deletion/reordering.
- This is an important CON for Method A in the report.
